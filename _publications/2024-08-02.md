excerpt: '1. Through fluid structure interation, flapping swimmers self-organize into stable emrgent formations without sensing and control. Across all fluid models and experimental data, the spacing between swimmers scales linearly with their flapping phase difference, revealing a universal passive matching rule. 

2. In side‑by‑side in‑phase formations the energy savings are shared nearly equally, whereas side‑by‑side antiphase costs more power; in contrast, in‑line and diagonal formations give almost all the benefit to the follower (up to about a 60 % drop in its cost of transport).

3. We developed a diagnostic tools "flow agreement parameter", which predicts where followers will stably position and how much energy they’ll save based on leader’s wake, without needing two‑way coupled simulations. 

4. Inline schools remain cohesive only up to three swimmers; the fourth (and any beyond) break away with no hydrodynamic gain. Side‑by‑side formations, however, stay together formuch more swimmers (up to 10 in our simulation), with almost equal energy savings.

The coordinated motion of animal groups through fluids is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion to individuals in the group. However, the connection between the spatial patterns observed in collectively moving animals and the energetic benefits at each position within the group remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we study the spontaneous emergence of cohesive formations in groups of fish, modeled as flapping foils, all heading in the same direction. We show in pairwise formations and with increasing group size that (1) in side-by-side arrangements, the reciprocal nature of flow coupling results in an equal distribution of energy re-quirements among all members, with reduction in cost of locomotion for swimmers flapping inphase but an increase in cost for swimmers flapping antiphase, and (2) in inline arrangements, flow coupling is non-reciprocal for all flapping phase, with energetic savings in favor of trailing swimmers, but only up to a finite number of swimmers, beyond which school cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once. We explain these findings mechanistically and we provide efficient diagnostic tools for identifying locations in the wake of single and multiple swimmers that offer op-portunities for hydrodynamic benefits to aspiring followers. Our results imply a connection between the resources generated by flow physics and social traits that influence greedy and cooperative group behavior.
