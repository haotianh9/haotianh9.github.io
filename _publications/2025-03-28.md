learning autonomous underwater navigation"

excerpt: '1. Egocentric underwater navigation (using body-frame flow and target measurements) performs as well as geocentric sensing (using inertial-frame measurements) when supplemented with local flow-gradient information, either transverse or tangential flow gradients.

2. Egocentric policies inherently obey rotational symmetry, maintaining high performance under arbitrary rotations of the flow field, whereas geocentric policies rapidly degrade when the flow alignment shifts.

3. When generalizing to different flows (including from reduced order modle to actual flow), both egocentric and egocentric policies are robust in naviagting through vortical wakes. 

4.  Analysis of the learned policies as vector fields reveals “preferred directions” (stable equilibria) that explain differing success rates upstream vs. downstream and the role of sensory ambiguities in decision-making.

Aquatic animals are much better at underwater navigation than robotic vehicles. Robots face major challenges in deep water because of their limited access to global positioning signals and ﬂow maps. These limitations, and the changing nature of water currents, support the use of reinforcement learning approaches, where the navigator learns through trial-and-error interactions with the ﬂow environment. But is it feasible to learn underwater navigation in the agent’s Umwelt, without any land references? Here, we tasked an artiﬁcial swimmer with learning to reach a speciﬁc destination in unsteady ﬂows by relying solely on egocentric observations, collected through onboard ﬂow sensors in the agent’s body frame, with no reference to a geocentric inertial frame. We found that while sensing local ﬂow velocities is sufﬁcient for geocentric navigation, successful egocentric navigation requires additional information of local ﬂow gradients. Importantly, egocentric navigation strategies obey rotational symmetry and are more robust in unfamiliar conditions and ﬂows not experienced during training. Our work expands underwater robot-centric learning, helps explain why aquatic organisms have arrays of ﬂow sensors that detect gradients, and provides physics-based guidelines for transfer learning of learned policies to unfamiliar and diverse ﬂow environments.
