I am a PhD candidate at [Prof.Kanso's Bio-inspired Motion Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/kansolab/) at Univeristy of Southern California. I got my B.S. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2019, where I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at J.C. Wu Center for Aerodynamics for four years. 


My CV can be found at [CV](files/CV/HHT_CV.pdf). 

Research interest
======
My research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to understand the locomotion of swimming and flying animals. 
<!-- , especially unsteady fluid dynamics problems related to swimming and flying animals.  -->
<!-- Thousands of species of animals have been constantly interacting with air and water of different conditions for millions of years.  -->
Natural selection has endued these animals fascinating ability in interacting with ambient flow structures, which is not achievable by any man-made vehicles.
Both the unsteady flow physics and the sensory control strategy behind these biological behaviors arouse my interests. 
<!-- I'm interested in combining physics based methods and data driven methods to understand bio-behaviors, which can not only help us in designing biomimic vehicles, but also uncover the physics mechanism underlying these behaviors.  --> 
I utilized methods from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), robo-physical experiment, reduced order modeling, reinforcement learning, and control theory to tackle these problems. For futrue direction, I'm curious about applying these knowledges to designing autonomous robots. 



Research projects
======
Currently, my work are composed of three parts: underwater sensing and navigation, collective behavior, and fluid structure interaction. 

In the first part of my work, we are working on underwater navigation based on local flow sensing. This problem is tacled by data-driven methods, e.g. model free reinforcement learning. Several scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, we studied the sensory control strategy of an agnet following a hydrodynamic trail without any visual. The second scenario considered a weak swimmer utilizing the unsteady flow feature to swim against a strong adversial flow. The third scenario asked what information of neighbooring fish can be decoded when fishes are swimming in school.

In these different scenarios, we asked the following quesitons. First, what flow property is the most effective sensory cue, whether it is velocity, pressure or vorticity? Second, which location is optimal for placing the sensors along the body of the swimmer? Third, what is the optimal sensory-control strategy in each task?

In terms of collective behavior of fish, "Vortex phase matching", which indicates a linear distance-phase relationship is well known in a two swimmer school. Here, we asked how does this understanding scales to larger school? How does different spatial pattern influence the distribution of power saving and school cohesion? More importantly, how does these understanding apply to real fish school, in which the topology are dynamically changing?


By performing vortex sheet and CFD simulation, we also looked at the role of body flexion in the performance of fish's swimming. 
We found that passive flexion is able to enhance swimming efficiency but cannot enahnce swimming speed. 
Moreover, by active flexion according to the flow field generated by passive flexion, the swimmer can enhance swimming speed and efficiency simutaneously in a region of the design space that overlaps with biological observations.

During my undergraduate study, I studied the unsteady aerodynamics mechanism of flapping wings by designing scaled model and carrying out PIV and force measurement experiemnts.

Interacting with fluid "in person"
======
I've also began training toward a private pilot at Santa Monica Flyers.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
